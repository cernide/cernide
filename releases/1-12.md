## v1.12.3

### Stream/Sidecar/Initializer

- **Fix**: Issue with `Minio/Ceph` artifacts store backend.

## v1.12.2

- **Enhancement**: Improve resolution logic of versioned entities.

### Commercial

- **Enhancement**: Add `locked` indicator to runs with model versions.

## v1.12.1

> This patch release was deleted.

## v1.12.0

### Agent
