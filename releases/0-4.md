This is a patch release on top of 0.4.3/0.4.2 containing no breaking changes., this version has no data or db migrations.

- Fix issue with IntegrityError when creating large number of experiments.
- Add error validation and redirection when creating experiments selection.
- Add alpha version of configurable security context.
- Update Polyaxon deploy to handle Minikube and MicroK8S.
- Optimize and reduce size of official images.
- Add dockgen package and initial work on local run mode.
- Add docs for Polyaxon Client authentication options.
- Update `log_artifact` and `log_artifacts` methods on the Experiment tracking API as an alternative to `experiment.outputs_stores.upload_file/dir`.
- Fix Polyaxon Chart ingress issues and typos.

## 0.4.3

- Re-enable possibility to create projects from dashboard.
- Add possibility to create experiments, groups, jobs, and builds from dashboard
  - Different creation modes
  - Creation from current project or from top level by choosing a project
- Add possibility to start notebooks for projects and tensorboards for projects, experiments, groups from the dashboard.
- Add possibility to restart experiments from the dashboard.
- Add tables for notebooks and tensorboards on the dashboard to easily see which tensorboards/notebooks are running or failing and their statuses.
- Add possibility to stop notebooks and tensorboards from dashboard without going to the individual experiment/group/project.
- Add support for multiple secrets in ingress TLS.
- Add support for Custom Cluster DNS resolvers.
- Add support for any DNS backend, users deploying Polyaxon on Kubernetes created by Kubespray won't have to switch DNS from CoreDNS to KubeDNS anymore.
- Add error handling for searches and metric views creation on dashboard.
- Add proper error handling for dashboard forms and search UIs, show errors generated by frontend validation and server side validation.
- Add loading indicators to differentiate between non-found entities and fetch in-progress.
- Add notebooks and tensorboards search APIs.
- Add several new fields to the search managers.
- Move NFS-Provisioner from Polyaxon Chart to a separate repo, users can use the NFS-PROVISIONER maintained Helm chart
  to deploy an NFS server to create MultiReadWrite volumes to use with Polyaxon.

- Remove NGINX Ingress from Polyaxon chart, and create documentation on how to use setup an NGINX Ingress from the stable chart.

  and docs will be updated to show how to use the major ones.
- Add missing fields to the polyaxon deploy spec validation.
- Add `polyaxon deploy` to deployment docs as it is now stable.
- Add alpha version for parcoords visualization to experiment groups.
- Add proper editor to show configs, dockerfiles, polyaxonfiles on the dashboard.
- Update searches and add some default searches (running, succeeded, and failed), more work to improve UI for creating searches and filters in the upcoming versions.
- Fix issue with Docker client unable to authenticate to private DockerHub registries.

  and set it to a singleton on the chart to prevent other users from changing the value.
- Several other internal fixes and improvements.
- Fix issue requiring users to manually invalidate browser cache.

## 0.4.2

- Add support of native Horovod experiments.
- Add new fields for experiments: backend and framework.
  - Framework can be used for any experiment as a special field/tag.
  - When using distributed experiments, some frameworks are recognized and will trigger a particular behavior.
  - Default backend is `native`, i.e. Polyaxon's native behavior for spawning experiments,
    additionally users can start distributed experiments on Kubeflow, by changing the backend field to `kubeflow`.
- Add helm charts to easily deploy TFJob, PytorchJob, and MPIJob without requiring the user to install a full Kubeflow deployment.
- Add spawners for distributed experiments on Kubeflow's operators: TFJob, PytorchJob, MPIJob.
- Update distributed experiments logs handling
  - Streaming experiment's logs show all logs.
  - User can stream specific job's logs.
  - Experiment UI shows default job's logs + user can check specific logs of each job.
- Update schema validation: now extra values or wrong values, even in nested sub-schemas, will raise a validation error.
- Update icons version.
