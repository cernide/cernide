## v0.1.6

- Fix Run meta info for builds, jobs, and groups on dashboard.
- Add draft for stats and actions.

## v0.1.5

- Build images: You can now pip install any file in your code folder without the need to call the file polyaxon_requirements.txt. Same thing if you need to build an image and have a shell script you just need to chmod +x the file and add it to the build setps.
- Add bookmarking: You can bookmark your projects/groups/experiments/jobs/builds with Dashboard/API/CLI/Client. If your team is running too many hyper params tuning in many projects, finding the important experiments/jobs/builds can be exhausting since it requires searching each time. Bookmarks allow you to easily save important runs and have access to them in an easy way.
- Add activity logs: shows recent create/update/delete activities in your team cluster or projects.
- Add history/recently viewed: This is also something that some teams showed a lot of interests in having, using the platform for a couple of weeks/months and creating thousands of experiments per day, makes it very hard to access the right information.
- Add support for external PostgreSQL: it's possible to link an external PostgreSQL database instead of the in-cluster one.
- SSO: Add support for Microsoft Azure authentication. in addition to github, gitlab, bittbucket, and LDAP, now you can allow your team to signup/login to Polyaxon with Microsoft Azure authentication
- Tooltips: for dates (creation date, update date, starting date, termination date) the dashboard shows a humanized version (e.g. X hours/days ago) this was not super helpful, and many users asked to have the possibility to see the exact values. On your dashboard you can see the dates values by hovering on any date and it will show datetime in the "YYYY-MM-DD HH: mm:ss" format.
- Add docs for replication: the docs now has a section outlining different strategies for replicating Polyaxon.
- Add docs for postgres HA strategies.
- Add docs for Microsoft Azure authentication.

## v0.1.4

- Fix some issues with node discovery
- Optimize access to k8s api
- Update image build process
- Optimize resources monitoring on k8s
- Add bookmarks for project, groups, experiments, jobs, builds
- Fix some UI issues
- Update docs
- Other changes from ðŸ‡·ðŸ‡º

## v0.1.3

- Add support for outputs reference from other jobs and experiments by id and name
- Update metrics tab with empty metrics
- Add some error handling for spec validation
- Fix the instruction pages

## v0.1.2

- Update instructions tabs
- Expose commit on the query spec
- Add query spec docs
- Add statuses tab
- Add metrics tab
- Add jobs cleaning
- Update logic for allowing commits after delete notebooks
- Update outputs logics for tensorboards

## v0.1.1

- Update dockerizer process: moved from a worker based process that handles image builds to pod being scheduled to build the image if does not exists
- Possibility to force rebuilding an image
- Separate run into 2 sections: run and build
- Add build specification
- Add tensorboard and notebook specifications
- Add generic job specification
- Optimize services images and reduce their sizes
- Upgrade docker client
- upgrade Kubernetes client
- Add and test replication for api, workers, and monitors
- Add tagging for projects, experiments, experiments groups, and jobs
- Add possibility to name runs (experiments, groups, jobs, builds)
- Add filtering, you can now filter based on our query spec: started_at:2015-01-01..2018-01-20, tags:foo|bar, metrics\_\_loss:<=0.1
- Add sorting, you can now sort by different attributes: -created_at, updated_at...
- Remove upper limit on hptuning, this will allow hptuning algorithm worker to consume more cpu and converge faster.
- Add download code: you can see now the commit made internally each time you upload the code
- Add outputs download for experiments and jobs
- Update tensorboards to support not only projects but also experiments and experiment group
- Update and enhance ui
