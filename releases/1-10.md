   * histogram.
   * activity calendar.
   * custom visualizations.
 * **New**: Add quick filters for agents, queues, and projects.
 * **New**: Allow to filter based on humanized dates and add filters for datetimes.
 * **New**: Allow to filter based on resources (Memory/CPU/GPU/Custom) and cost.
 * **Enhancement**: Improve dashboards in comparison table.
 * **Enhancement**: Improve graph view rendering speed.
 * **Enhancement**: Use the new virtualized cell rendering to speedup rendering of the comparison table with large number of columns and rows and the logs table.
