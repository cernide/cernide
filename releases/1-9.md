## v1.9.0 [WIP]

### CLI

 * **New**: `polyaxon run -MP` multi-params to provide several values.
   * Similar to `polyaxon run -P` but instead of passing a single param, it passes a sweep.
   * Creates multiple runs from the CLI.
   * **Note**: Advanced use-cases will still require creating a polyaxonfile with a `matrix` section.
 * **Enhancement**: Add missing command for setting/updating the stage of a component/model version.
 * **Enhancement**: Improve `polyaxon ops restart --copy` to allow customizing the paths to copy, e.g. `polyaxon ops restart --copy-dir=dir1 --copy-dir=path/dir2 --copy-file=path/dir3/file1`.
 * **Enhancement**: Improve `polyaxon run` command to support both `-u/--upload` and `--eager` for non-managed `Matrix` operations.
 * **Enhancement**: Allow to restart/copy operations with new name, description, tags, and meta-info.

### Core

 * **Enhancement**: Improve `RunClient.create` method to correctly resolve references before submitting operations to the API in Polyaxon CE.
 * **Enhancement**: Increase default `requests.memory` for auxiliary containers to prevent scheduling pods on low memory nodes and to prevent impacting other core components.
 * **Enhancement**: Improve restart with upload, currently restarting runs with uploaded artifacts fail because of missing artifacts.
 * **Enhancement**: Improve restart with copy mode, users can provide the paths to copy, by default it will copy all artifacts to preserve the previous behavior.
 * **Enhancement**: Refactor approval process to use a more generic pending logic.
 * **Enhancement**: Improve matrix creation in eager mode and clean-up the matrix run placeholder.
 * **Fix**: Bug with `RunClient.log_tags` missing a check for the case when tags are initially `None`.

### UI

 * **Enhancement**: Use the new virtualized cell rendering to speed rendering of the comparison table with large number of columns and rows and the logs table.
 * **Enhancement**: Add UI fields to the pass name, description, tags in the restart form.
 * **Enhancement**: Add possibility to set the paths (dirs/files) to copy when enabling copy mode on restart.

### House Keeping

 * **Enhancement**: Update tests requirements.

### Commercial

 * **New**: Add status to early stopping strategies to allow users to define what status should be used when an early stopping condition is met, default value will stay the same `stopped`.
 * **New**: Allow to update connections configuration from UI:
   * Owner/Managers can opt into updating the connections catalog and other configs directly from the UI.
   * This is an opt-in feature and can be reverted to YAML based configuration, in which case a redeploy is required.
   * The `artifactsStore` as well as several required configurations still need to be deployed using the Helm chart.
   * This feature can be enabled on per-agent basis.
 * **Enhancement**: Investigate the new `suspend` feature to provide immediate concurrency change instead of the current [draining logic](/faq/How-does-changing-concurrency-work/).
 * **Enhancement**: Add `is locked` indicator to runs linked to a model version in the model registry to reduce confusion.
 * **Enhancement**: Improve UI pipeline progress indicator to reflect the final status of the runs managed by the pipeline, currently it shows a green progress line.
 * **Enhancement**: Add possibility to batch cleaning operations in a single job based on the artifacts store.
   * This should avoid overwhelming cluster(s) where the agent is running.
 * **Enhancement**: Add project runtimes customization to the settings page.
   * Admins can select runtimes to allow on a specific project.
 * **Enhancement**: Speedup bulk insertions and updates.
