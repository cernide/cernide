## v1.9.0 [WIP]

### CLI

 * **New**: `polyaxon run -MP` multi-params to provide several values.
   * Similar to `polyaxon run -P` but instead of passing a single param, it passes a sweep.
   * Creates multiple runs from the CLI.
   * **Note**: Advanced use-cases will still require creating a polyaxonfile with a `matrix` section.

### Core

 * **Enhancement**: Improve `RunClient.create` method to correctly resolve references before submitting operations to the API.
 * **Enhancement**: Increase default `requests.memory` for auxiliary containers to scheduling pod on low memory nodes and prevent impacting other core components.
 * **Enhancement**: Improve restart with upload, currently restarting runs with uploaded artifacts fail because of missing artifacts.
 * **Enhancement**: Improve restart with copy mode, users can provide the paths to copy, by default it will copy all artifacts to preserve the previous behavior.

### Tracking

 * **New**: Add flag `is_series` with default `True` to `log_metric(s)` to allow users to log single metric without creating an event file.

### UI

 * **Enhancement**: Use the new virtualized cell rendering to speed rendering of the comparison table with large number of columns and rows and the logs table.
 * **Enhancement**: Add possibility to set the paths to copy when enabling copy mode on restart.

### Commercial

 * **New**: Add status to early stopping strategies to allow users to define what status should be used when an early stopping condition is met, default value will stay the same `stopped`.
 * **Enhancement**: Add `is locked` indicator to runs linked to a model version in the model registry to reduce confusion.
 * **Enhancement**: Improve UI pipeline progress indicator to reflect the final status of the runs managed by the pipeline, currently it shows a green progress line.
 * **Enhancement**: Add possibility to batch cleaning operations in a single job based on the artifacts store.
   * This should avoid overwhelming cluster(s) where the agent is running.
 * **Enhancement**: Add project runtimes customization to the settings page.
   * Admins can select runtimes to allow on a specific project.
