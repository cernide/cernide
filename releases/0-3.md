## v0.3.9

- **important** This version supports only one outputs (either a store or a volume), to simplify deployment of the CE version and reduce confusion.
- Refactor build process to support plugins and several backends
- Make native builder lighter.
- Add support for building containers with Kaniko as a backend in Beta.
- Add possibility to use own dockerfile to build containers.
- Add possibility to use contexts to only mount sub-folders in a repo for specific tasks (e.g. mount /code/processing module for data extraction in job, and /code/training for training in experiments).
- Add support for running Jupyter Labs in addition to Jupyter notebooks.
- Allow in-cluster authentication when using notebooks (users can create experiment and track metrics/tags/params in notebooks created by Polyaxon seamlessly).
- Improve jobs'/experiments' authentications.
- Disable creation of polyaxonfile.yaml by default on `init` commands to allow users to put their polyaxonfiles wherever they want.
- Improve usage of external repos (add support for using an access token or user/password).
- Enable project to either use in-cluster code tracking or code on github/bitbucket/gitlab.
- Update several internal components handling fetching, extracting and archiving external repos.
- Improve notebooks build process: Current version only allows serverless notebooks (mounting in-cluster code will be re-enabled later).
- Add several checks to Experiment Group Studies to prevent non-ending groups on errors.
- Handle missing experiments in suggestion algorithms gracefully.
- Enable logs on buckets (GCS/S3/Azure).
- Re-enable tensorboards to continuously add experiments in project/groups as they output values.
- Improve and separate deletion/archiving of projects/groups/experiments/jobs, and extend UI to support it.
- Make default tensorboard image configurable.
- Make all components' logging level configurable with `logLevel`.
- Extend `polyaxon run` to switch project context and run a config on any project, e.g. `polyaxon run -p projectA -f /polyaxonfiles/config1.yaml`.
- Allow users to either upload code `polyaxon upload` or set external repo `polyaxon project git --url=https//... --private`,
  so that code tracking can be either in-cluster or on external repos, next version will be introducing github/gitlab hooks to automate pushing to training.
- Add `polyaon deploy` and `polyaxon teardown` to check a config deployment file, deploy a cluster, upgrade, or teardown in Beta.
- Allow to customize TPU scheduling: default tensorflow version and resource key.
- Improve installing cloud stores dependencies with polyaxon-client: `polyaxon-client[gcs]`, `polyaxon-client[s3]`, `polyaxon-client[azure]`.
- Improve tracking of experiments logs running outside of Polyaxon.
- Fix TPU scheduling.
- Fix some issues preventing stopping unschedulable notebooks/tensorboards.
- Fix detection of warning pod statuses.

- Update ingress to allow users to create an ingress with an IP only without requiring a host.

  to allow users to perform a dry-run of their code when used outside of a Polyaxon context without crashing.
- Add possibility to disable verify ssl for Polyaxon client and Polyaxon cli.
- Update default rabbitmq image version.
- Several internal enhancements.

## v0.3.7

- Add validation for values containing lists.
- Add copy-to-clipboard to preserve configuration yaml structure when copying from browser.
- Add confirmation dialogue before deleting/stopping entities on Dashborad.
- Add better logs handling for in-cluster jobs and experiments running on other platforms.
- Enable admin view by default with useful models only.
- Enhance statuses watch.
- Add gzip decorator for some endpoints.
- Enhance stores and options management (internal improvements).

- Fix some issues related to detecting changes on Azure.
- Fix error when the command `config --list` when the cli configuration is not initialized.
- Extend in-cluster examples.

- Introduce Polyaxon deployment lifecycle management (Beta).

## v0.3.5

- Update logging logic, logs are now collected lazily.
- Use k8s logs timestamps to avoid lags between Polyaxon and k8s.
- Expose pod name on experiments jobs, jobs, builds, tensorboards in UI & CLI.
- Update sidecar logic, first step to implement a collector sidecar logic for artifacts/outputs.
- Deletion of `projects`, `experiment groups`, `experiments`, `jobs`, is now asynchronous, and results in archiving the entity for a certain period.
- Add archiving period, configurable with `cleaningIntervals.archived` default 7 days, to allow users to recover deleted entities, otherwise, archived entities older than this interval get cleaned.
- Add support for TPU scheduling.
- Fix study groups issue related to creating chunks of serializable numpy suggestions.
- Schedule configmap and secret refs for builds created by experiments/jobs/notebooks.
- [Security, XSS fixes] Update: bootstrap 3.4.0.
- Update service account usage for workers to get less permissions.
- Calculate run time based on running status instead of starting status, the reason is that an experiment can be sent to k8s scheduler, hence it can wait for some time for resources before it starts actually running.
- Fix UI issue in the job overview tab.
- Fix smoothing algorithm, was dropping the first metric resulting in wrong visualization, now the smoothing has similar behavior to the Tensorboard's.
- Disable ingress by default, and use LoadBalancer as default value for charts.
- Add host list directly on ingress to use when tls is not enabled.
- Remove deprecated `polyaxon-logs` service.
- Use ocular for monitoring statuses.
- Use polystores for managing stores.

- Add UI meta info about the restarted/resumed/copied jobs/experiments and add ref to the original entity.
- Add termination reason/status code to failed runs.
- Fix issue with resumed experiments' outputs getting wrong artifacts.
- Update statuses logging logic to not drop past events caused by concurrency.
- Always insert statuses while respecting the state machine before the event was detected.
