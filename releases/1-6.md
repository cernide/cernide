## v1.6.1 [WIP]

### UI

  * **Enhancement**: Use the new virtualized cell rendering to speed rendering of the comparison table with large number of columns and rows.

## v1.6.0 [WIP]

### Core

 * **Security**: Upgrade packages with security issues.
 * **New**: Add file initializer:
   * Avoids a clone if only a file or script can be generated before starting a run,
   * Can be used to initialize a python/shell... script that should be executed by the user in another init container or the main container.
   * Can be used to initialize a YAML/Json/... file that can be used by another init container or the main container.
 * **New**: Add completion and validation for Polyaxonfiles in IDEs (VSCode, Pycharm, ...).
 * **Enhancement**: Add missing unique constraint on project names in Polyaxon CE.
 * **Enhancement**: Add missing delete artifacts methods to `RunClient`: `delete_artifact` and `delete_artifacts`.
 * **Enhancement**: Add `upload_artifacts_dir` as a utils function around `upload_artifacts` to streamline crawling files while respecting the ignore patterns.
 * **Enhancement**: Move lifecycle created_at/started_at/finished_at to core.
 * **Enhancement**: Improve logs disk footprint by changing the persistence  format, around `35%`less space.
 * **Enhancement**: Avoid unnecessary API updates syncing old meta info states.
 * **Enhancement**: Avoid unnecessary artifacts store check for temp logs.
 * **Enhancement**: Reduce potential egress by `30% ~ 50%`.
 * **Enhancement**: Add sidecar plugin to allow controlling and overriding the global sidecar definition per operation.
 * **Enhancement**: Improve preset's partial validation to disable required fields on restart/resume operations and presets definitions.
 * **Enhancement**: Sanitize and transform tracking event names to a fully qualified names.
 * **Enhancement**: Allow reading polyaxonfiles without extension as `yaml` by default.

### Tracking

  * **New**: Add offline mode tracking:
    * Enables tracking, logging, and generating all assets, events and logs.
    * Passes through all API calls and generates corresponding run manifest as a JSON blob.
    * Enables visualizing offline runs in notebooks.
    * Exposes methods to sync the runs to the metadata API and artifacts store.   
  * **Enhancement**: Improve `log_model` by allowing logging model lineages without the event files.
  * **Fix**: Issue with Pytorch Ignite logger.

### CLI

 * **New**: Add `ops sync` command to sync offline runs and upload related artifacts.
 * **New**: Add `ops ls --offline` command to show all current offline runs.

### UI

 * **Enhancement**: Improve main container logs detection.
 * **Fix**: Issue with redundant logs requests.
 * **Fix**: Typo in some action forms.

### Operator

 * **Enhancement**: Improve operator syncing logic to perform recurrent checks.
 * **Fix**: Issue with `maxConcurrentReconciles` configuration.
 * **Fix**: Regression introduced with the last change with pod's state 

### Deployment & Setup

 * **Enhancement**: Update MPIOperator chart to the latest version.
 * **Enhancement**: Simplify deployment of replica agent by exposing a flag `isReplica`.

### House Keeping

 * **Enhancement**: Update testing requirements.

### Docs

 * **Enhancement**: Update types docs with init examples.
 * **Enhancement**: Add docs for enabling IDE completion and validation.

### Commercial

 * **Enhancement**: Improve updates auditor performance.
 * **Enhancement**: Add missing write actions in activity logs.
 * **Enhancement**: Add several heuristic to improve pipelines performance.
 * **Enhancement**: Automatically increase sidecar sync interval for matrix and DAG operations to reduce API calls and artifacts syncs.
 * **Enhancement**: Do not cascade default user preset/queue deletion.
 * **Enhancement**: Prefix connections lineage with agent name to distinguish same connection names used in multiple agents.
 * **Enhancement**: Send user's role with hub and model versions.
 * **Enhancement**: Hide delete buttons on model version and component version for non admin users.
 * **Enhancement**: Hide edit button on readme for viewer users in the run overview page.
 * **Enhancement**: Add warning when a user lands on a valid project under an organization they have access to but with restrictions.
 * **Enhancement**: Improve some project/component/hub level permissions.
 * **Enhancement**: Improve confusing aspects about team management, e.g. second role promotion on team level.
 * **Enhancement**: Improve spacing in analytics page.
 * **Enhancement**: Improve compilation and access error context information.
 * **Enhancement**: Improve backend monitoring.
