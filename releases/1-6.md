- **Enhancement**: Add missing delete artifacts methods to `RunClient`: `delete_artifact` and `delete_artifacts`.
- **Enhancement**: Add `upload_artifacts_dir` as a utils function around `upload_artifacts` to streamline crawling files while respecting the ignore patterns.
- **Enhancement**: Move lifecycle created_at/started_at/finished_at to core.
- **Enhancement**: Improve logs disk footprint by changing the persistence format, around `35%`less space.
- **Enhancement**: Avoid unnecessary API updates syncing old meta info states.
- **Enhancement**: Avoid unnecessary artifacts store check for temp logs.
- **Enhancement**: Reduce potential egress by `30% ~ 50%`.

- **New**: Add offline mode tracking:
  - Enables tracking, logging, and generating all assets, events and logs.
  - Passes through all API calls and generates corresponding run manifest as a JSON blob.
  - Enables visualizing offline runs in notebooks.
  - Exposes methods to sync the runs to the metadata API and artifacts store.
- **Enhancement**: Add `log_model_ref` to allow logging model lineages without the event files.
- **Enhancement**: Improve debugging API related errors by providing more context about the client configuration, where information was loaded, and path to the local cache if it was used.
- **Enhancement**: Improve and consolidate all client decorators into a single decorator to improve usage in interactive debuggers.
- **Enhancement**: Improve manual statuses logging.
- **Enhancement**: Simplify running and tracking several runs in the same process.
