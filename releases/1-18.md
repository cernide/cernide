- **Enhancement**: Improve statuses watch to refresh the table instead of drawing a new table.
- **Enhancement**: Improve wait for condition to update the last status in place.
- **Enhancement**: Add missing `stages` to commands `components`, `artifacts`, and `models` to list stage transitions and conditions.
- **Enhancement**: Improve pull logic to create a valid structure `/base/path/PROJECT_NAME/runs`, `/base/path/PROJECT_NAME/models`, ...
- **Enhancement**: Improve overall CLI behavior with better interactive spinner and upload/download progress bar.
- **Enhancement**: Add rendering for readme section to project, run, component, model, artifact `get` commands.

### Client

- **Beta**: Async client version.
- **New**: Add promote method to a model version or artifact version directly from the `RunClient`:
  - `RunClient.promote_to_model_version` this is similar to `ProjectClient.register_model_version` but directly from the run client instance.
  - `RunClient.promote_to_artifact_version` this is similar to `ProjectClient.register_artifact_version` but directly from the run client instance.
- **New**: Add `get_runs_artifacts_lineage` to `RunClient` to allow listing artifacts lineage information from multiple runs under the same project based on a query specification.
- **New**: Expose new sdks on the client, the new endpoints will only be accessible to users with enough permissions or it will raise 401/403 errors:
  - Allows listing and interacting with agents.

  - Allows listing cross project runs.
- **Enhancement**: Add retries configuration option.
- **Enhancement**: Improve issues around `SSL` verification.
- **Enhancement**: Improve download logic based on a lineage reference.
- **Enhancement**: Improve wait for condition to be resilient to backend errors.
- **Enhancement**: Improve client decorator to handle inline configurations in addition to the global settings.

### Operator

- **Enhancement**: Update training operator to use the newest Kubeflow release.

### Query Language

- **New**: Allow filtering by connections:
  - By name `connections.name: CONNECTION1 | CONNECTION2`
  - By tag `connections.tags: TAG1 | TAG2`
  - By kind `connections.kind: git`
- **New**: Allow filtering by artifacts lineage:
  - By name `artifacts.name: LINEAGE1 | LINEAGE2`
  - By kind `artifacts.kind: model`
  - By path `artifacts.path: foo/bar`
  - By state `artifacts.state: STATE`
