- **New**: Add new guide about manual volume, secrets, and configmaps mounting.
- **New**: Add new guide about service accounts usage.
- **New**: Add new guide about security context usage.
- **New**: Add more information about the compiler and variables resolution in the context section.
- **Fix**: Typos.

### Agent

- **Fix** Move scheduled status logging to the agent controller.

### Commercial

- **Enhancement**: Allow requesting all inputs, outputs, artifacts as dictionaries without specifying values by keys.
- **Enhancement**: Improve handling of unexpected compilation errors, and set the operation to failed to notify the user.

## v1.5.0

### Core

- **Enhancement**: Allow to specify path from and path to in the init artifacts specification.
- **Enhancement**: Improve restart with copy mode, the artifacts are now initialized under the new run.
- **Enhancement**: Improve several APIs response time.
- **Enhancement**: Allow passing variables to the concurrency key in matrix algorithms and dag.
- **Enhancement**: Add `uuid` type parser and validator to the V1IO.
- **Enhancement**: Improve mount path for artifacts connections in init containers.
- **Enhancement**: Remove restriction on parameters with `contextOnly` and `toInit`.
- **Enhancement**: Use `-R` instead of `-r` for recursive copy, a regression was introduced when the base image was updated.
- **Fix**: Issue in init container logs when the artifacts are coming from the default artifacts store.

### Docs

- **Enhancement**: Move context docs to a separate section.
- **Fix**: Typos.

### Commercial

- **New**: Add `Join` and `JoinParam` specifications. As opposed to the `matrix` section which allows to parallelize operations using hyperparameter tuning or mapping, the `joins` section allows:
  - to filter, aggregate, and annotate inputs/outputs/artifacts from multiple or parallel upstream runs based on query/sort/limit/offset specification.
  - to initialize an operation with all artifacts from several upstream runs dynamically.
- **New**: Implement logic for internal `events`. Users can now run full event based workflows, and in future iterations, it will be possible to start operations based on external events and internal alerts.
- **New**: Implement logic for `hooks`. Hooks can be used:
  - to send webhooks
  - to send notifications and alerts to slack, discord, github, ...
  - to integrate with external systems
  - to initiate a test/eval operation after training.
  - ...
- **New**: Add new lineage tabs for: connections, actions & hooks, upstream/downstream runs.
- **Enhancement**: Expose namespace and artifacts store connection used on the run overview page.
- **Enhancement**: Allow filtering runs by the artifacts store connection name used.
- **Enhancement**: Use `globals.*` for requesting `uuid`, `name`, `status` and other general values from upstream operations, similar to normal operation context to have more consistent interface.
- **Enhancement**: Add several heartbeat processes to clean distressed pipelines and runs.
- **Enhancement**: Improve auditing and activity logs.
- **Enhancement**: Optimize events access to the database.
- **Enhancement**: Mark operations with false conditions as `skipped` instead of `failed`.
- **Enhancement**: Improve the run edge collection logic to conserve metadata, types, and reference.

- **Fix**: Issue when a schedule is attached to a matrix, the metadata is missing and the matrix icon not showing in the sidebar.
- **Fix**: Issue with schedule not stopping properly and keep scheduling new runs.
