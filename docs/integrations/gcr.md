Integrate your Google GCR (Google container registry) with Polyaxon to start your machine learning and deep learning experiments on Kubernetes.

## Overview

You can easily add many private registries to Polyaxon to pull private images and use them when scheduling your deep learning and machine learning experiments on Kubernetes using Polyaxon.

## Enable Container Registry API

Start with enabling the Container Registry API by logging into Google Cloud and navigating to Container Registry on your project.

## Create a service account on GCS with storage admin role

 1. Go to console.cloud.google.com
 2. Make sure your project is selected
 3. Click <top-left menu w/ three horizontal bars> -> IAM & Admin -> Service Accounts menu option
 4. Click Create service account
 5. Give your account a descriptive name such as “polyaxon-gcr-access”
 6. Click Role -> Storage -> Storage Admin menu option
 7. Click Create Key
 8. Leave key type as default of JSON
 9. Click Create

## Create a secret containing the credentials to use with GCR

In order to create a valid secret using the service account key, you need to create base64 auth based on the `_json_key` and value in `json.json`.

So using python you can do:

```python
import base64
base64.b64encode('_json_key:{"type": "service_account", "project_id": "my_project", "private_key_id": "ajshvasjhqweqetquytqut17253871238", "private_key": "-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\nASBHJASJDASBDJAJHSBDJB/sfbdj1223"}'.encode())

```

## Create an auths config file

```json
{
    "auths": {
        "gcr.io": {
            "auth": "anNvbl9rZXk6eyJ0eXBlIjogInNlcnZpY2VfYWNjb3VudCIsICJwcm9qZWN0X2lkIjogIm15X3Byb2plY3QiLCAicHJpdmF0ZV9rZXlfaWQiOiAiYWpzaHZhc2pocXdlcWV0cXV5dHF1dDE3MjUzODcxMjM4IiwgInByaXZhdGVfa2V5IjogIi0tLS0tQkVHSU4gUFJJVkFURSBLRVktLS0tLQpBU0JISkFTSkRBU0JESkFKSFNCREpCL3NmYmRqMTIyMyJ9=",
        }
    }
}
```

## Create a secret with config.json as a name

```bash
kubectl create secret generic docker-conf --from-file=config.json=./config.json -n polyaxon
```

## Create a docker registry access in the UI

In Polyaxon's stores, add a new entry and link to this secret, and set the host to `gcr.io/my-project`, `us.gcr.io/my-project`, `eu.gcr.io/my-project`, or `asia.gcr.io/my-project`.

![access](../../content/images/integrations/docker-access.png)


## Make this access as default

After creating the access you need to mark it as default, so that Polyaxon uses it for scheduling builds. 


## Using the secret for pull only

If you wish to only use this credential secret for pulling images and the in-cluster registry for pushing, you should leave the host field empty.

## You can include allow the docker process to pull from different registries

To allow this access to pull from other registries, you can set as many other auths and credsStore.
