Integrate your Azure Container Registry ACR with Polyaxon to start your machine learning and deep learning experiments on Kubernetes.

## Overview

You can easily add many private registries to Polyaxon to pull private images and use them when scheduling your deep learning and machine learning experiments on Kubernetes using Polyaxon.

## Create a service principle and ArcPush

To use Azure Container Registry (ACR), you will need to provide proper credentials. 
You can do so by creating a [Service Principal](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/app-objects-and-service-principals) 
that has the [AcrPush](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#acrpush) role.

 1. Login to your Azure account:
    
    ```bash
    az login
    ```

 2. Select your chosen subscription:
 
    ```bash
    az account set -s <SUBSCRIPTION>
    ```

 3. If you do not have a Resource Group, then create one:
 
    ```bash
    az group create --name <RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME> --location <RESOURCE_GROUP_LOCATION> --output table
    ```    
    
    > <RESOURCE_GROUP_LOCATION> refers to a data centre region. See a list of regions [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/global-infrastructure/locations/).
    
 4. Create the ACR if not you don't have one already
 
    ```bash
    az acr create --name <ACR_NAME> --resource-group <RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME> --sku Basic --output table
    ```
 
 5. Login in the ACR:

    ```bash
    az acr login --name <ACR_NAME>
    ```
 
 6. Note down the AppID of the ACR:
 
    ```bash
    az acr show --name <ACR_NAME> --query "id" -o tsv
    ```
    
    We need this in order to assign the AcrPush role which will allow Polyaxon to push images to the registry. You can save this to a bash variable like so:
    
    ```bash
    ACR_ID=$(az acr show --name <ACR_NAME> --query "id" -o tsv)
    ```
    
 7. Create a Service Principal with the AcrPush role assignment:
 
    ```bash
    az ad sp create-for-rbac --name <SP_NAME> --role AcrPush --scope <ACR_ID>
    ```

    > <SP_NAME> is a recognisable name for your Service Principal

    > <ACR_ID> is the AppID we retrieved in step 6 above. You can replace this with ${ACR_ID} if you saved it to a bash variable.
    
    Note down the AppID and password that are output by this step. These are the login credentials Polyaxon will use to access the registry.

## Create a secret to allow access to ACR

In order to create a valid secret using the login credentials from previous step, you need to create base64 auth based on the AppID and password.

So using python you can do:

```python
import base64
base64.b64encode('principal_id:password}'.encode())
```

## Create an auths config file

```json
{
    "auths": {
        "https://<ACR_NAME>.azurecr.io": {
            "auth": "<BASE64_VALUE>",
        }
    }
}
```

## Create a secret with config.json as a name

```bash
kubectl create secret generic docker-conf --from-file=config.json=./config.json -n polyaxon
```
  
## Make this access as default

After creating the access you need to mark it as default, so that Polyaxon uses it for scheduling builds. 


## Using the secret for pull only

If you wish to only use this credential secret for pulling images and the in-cluster registry for pushing, you should leave the host field empty.

## You can include allow the docker process to pull from different registries

To allow this access to pull from other registries, you can set as many other auths and credsStore.
