## Overview

A component can have one or more versions, each version:
 * Conveys useful information about a specific component version/variant.
 * Reflects changes in the logic of your component where previous versions are still used or referenced by runs.
 * can have multiple versions, similar to docker images, to avoid breaking old experiments and workflows.

## Component version create

You can create your component versions using the CLI, API, or the UI.

### CLI

polyaxon hub push --name OWNER_NAME/COMPONENT_NAME[:tag] --description ... --tags tag1,tag2,... -f path/to/polyaxonfile.yaml
