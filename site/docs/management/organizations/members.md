## Overview

Membership in Polyaxon is handled at the organizational level.
The system is designed so each end user is assigned to a single Polyaxon account, which can then join one or more organizations.
Each end user should have their own account, where they can manage their personal preferences and security settings.
You can invite members to your organization and assign them roles with specific permissions.

## Organization members

After creating an organization, you can invite or remove members using the organization's settings.

You can also update their roles.

## Managing users and permissions

Users with the `owner` role can promote, demote, and delete all users up to the `owner` level.

Users with the `manager` role can manage all users except users with the `owner` role.

Users with the `admin` role can only manage configurations and restrictions on the project, model registry, and component hub level.

## Team level roles

Users with `outsider`, `viewer`, `member`, and `admin` can be invited to teams and they can be promoted up-to the `admin` level role, e.g. `outisder` -> `member`, `member` -> `admin`.

Each project, component hub, model registry can restrict access by selecting users and teams. 
If teams are selected, users will act based on the highest role they have in the teams they belong to and have access to that entity.

Please check [teams section](/docs/management/organizations/teams/) for more details.

## Re-assigning seats

By removing a user from the members table, you can re-invite or add a different user based on a new email.
Only users with the `owner` and `manager` roles can add/remove users, in fact, 
only these two roles have access to the organization level settings.
